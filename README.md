#Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

##Business Understanding and Overview
In the telecom industry, preventing customer churn is crucial for long-term success. This data analysis focuses on understanding customer attrition by conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that guide informed decision-making.

##Target Variable
Initial findings show an overall churn rate of 26.58%, serving as our base target value for future comparisons.

##Missing Data Analysis
###Data Type Correction:
"Total Charges" column data type corrected to float64 for accurate analysis.
###Handling Null Values:
11 null records in "Total Charges" (0.15% of data) were dropped, resulting in 7032 records.
##Data Cleaning
###Tenure Grouping for Visualization:
"Tenure Months" grouped into six bins for improved visualization, creating a new column, "tenure_group."
###Irrelevant Column Removal:
"Customer ID" and "Tenure" dropped as irrelevant for focused analysis.
##Initial Findings of Univariate Analysis
Converted categorical values to numerical using get_dummies.
Explored correlations between numerical features and "Churn" column.
Identified attributes associated with higher churn rates.
###Univariate Analysis Highlights
Customers with attributes like month-to-month contracts, no online security or tech support, and high monthly charges exhibit higher churn rates.
Senior citizens, customers without partners or dependents, and those with Fiber Optic Internet Service are more likely to churn.
Different contract types and payment methods influence churn rates.
Absence of add-on services like online security, online backup, device protection, and tech support increases churn likelihood.
Customers without streaming services are more likely to churn, but interestingly, those with streaming services like TV and movies also show significant churn rates.
Monthly and total charges exhibit clear correlations with churn.
##Next Steps Planned
###Detailed Bivariate Analysis:

Conduct a detailed examination of how different factors relate to each other concerning customer churn through bivariate analysis.
###Insights Generation:

Summarize key insights from the analysis to highlight crucial patterns and relationships.
###Machine Learning Prediction:

Utilize insights to build a machine learning model predicting future churners.
###Data-Driven Decision Making: Integrate advanced analytics and machine learning for data-driven decisions, ensuring competitiveness in the telecom market.
